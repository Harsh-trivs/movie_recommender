Movie Recommender
Overview
The Movie Recommender application provides movie recommendations based on a selected movie from a dropdown menu. This project is built using Python, Streamlit, and pickle files for model storage. The recommender system helps users find movies similar to their preferences.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the Movie Recommender application locally:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Jupyter Notebook
Streamlit
Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender
Set Up Your Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install jupyter streamlit
Additionally, install any other dependencies that your project might require using pip.

Generate Pickle Files
The main.ipynb Jupyter notebook is used to train the model and save it as a pickle file. To generate these pickle files:

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
Execute all cells in the notebook. This will train the model and save it as a pickle file in the same directory.

Run the Streamlit App
Once the pickle files are generated, you can run the Streamlit application using the main.py file:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
This command will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser. You can interact with the app to select a movie and receive recommendations.

Usage
Select a Movie: Use the dropdown menu to select a movie from the list.
